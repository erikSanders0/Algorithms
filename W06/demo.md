01.	**Select two different types of data storage**
- SSD and removable USB 
02.	**Identify and explain at least 3 different concepts, techniques, and/or recovery solutions such as hardware and/or software for data loss or recovery**

- When you have a failing SSD you can create a byte-by-byte disk image of the SSD and then use recovery software to scan the backup image. 

- Disk Drill can read data from crashed SSDâ€™s, it can search for corrupted data and the uncorrepted, and retrieves lost files in data partitions.

- Degaussing is where you deliver a powerful enough electromagnetic pulse that it permanently destroys all data on the disk. You cannot recover data from the disk once it has been degaussed.

> *The most simple way to back up a computer is to copy over folders from a directory and then paste them onto either a cloud or physical device so that if anything happens to the local device you can recover the data from the backup.*
> This can be done by simply inserting the device into your computer and then finding the material you want to back and select it and copy it by pressing Ctrl + C. You can then paste it by using Ctrl + V. Once this is done you can remove the device and save it for a rainy day. Take good care of it and be sure to recopy the data every now and then to make sure that the data is still intact.
